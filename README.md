# X-Ray Photon Transport Simulation Framework

A modular and extensible simulation framework for **X-ray imaging** based on stochastic photon transport in voxelized phantoms.  
Supports both **Monte Carlo (MC)** and **Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC)** sampling methods for comparative analysis of convergence behavior and image accuracy.

Developed as part of a Master's thesis in mathematics with a focus on variance reduction techniques in medical image simulation.
